# PP MAMS Mod Loading Issue - Diagnostic Report & Proposed Fix

**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Mod not loading at all - zero references in debug log

## Problem Summary

The pp_mams mod is completely invisible to X4. Despite fixes to:
- XML syntax (validated)
- File permissions (755 like other working mods)
- Content.xml structure (`enabled="1"`, `version="100"`)
- Simplified MD script with clear debug messages

**Result**: Still no references to "pp_mams" anywhere in the debug log.

## Current Mod Structure

```
pp_mams/
├── content.xml          # Fixed but contains unnecessary libraries declaration
├── mdscripts/
│   └── pp_mams.xml     # Simplified to just initialization - NO Lua calls
├── libraries/
│   └── pp_mams.lua     # Unused file that shouldn't exist for current test
└── README.md
```

## Key Issue Identified: Unnecessary Lua Declaration

**Problem**: We're declaring a Lua library but not using it:

```xml
<!-- In content.xml - SHOULD BE REMOVED -->
<libraries>
  <library name="pp_mams" file="pp_mams.lua" />
</libraries>
```

**Current MD script has NO Lua calls**:
- Only uses `debug_text`, `show_notification`, `write_to_logbook`
- No `run_script` calls
- No Lua functions

**Why this matters**:
1. X4 may be trying to load pp_mams.lua and failing silently
2. Library declaration without usage confuses mod loader
3. Most simple MD-only mods don't have `<libraries>` sections

## Proposed Fixes (In Order of Priority)

### Fix 1: Remove Unnecessary Lua Components
```xml
<!-- REMOVE this entire section from content.xml -->
<libraries>
  <library name="pp_mams" file="pp_mams.lua" />
</libraries>
```

**Minimal content.xml should be**:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<content id="pp_mams" name="PP MAMS Test" author="Meldrey" version="100" date="2025-09-28" save="false" enabled="1">
  <text language="44" description="Test mod for loading verification" />
  <mdscript name="pp_mams" />
</content>
```

### Fix 2: Remove Dependency Declaration
```xml
<!-- ALSO REMOVE - might be causing version conflicts -->
<dependency version="700" />
```

### Fix 3: Create Fresh Test Instance
- Copy to new directory: `pp_mams_minimal`
- Use different ID to avoid any cached disable state
- Test ultra-minimal version first

### Fix 4: Verify In-Game Extension Status
- Check Settings > Extensions menu in X4
- Ensure mod appears and is enabled
- Try disabling/re-enabling if it appears

## Files to Modify

1. **content.xml**: Remove `<libraries>` and `<dependency>` sections
2. **Delete libraries/** directory entirely for this test
3. **MD script**: Keep current simplified version

## Success Criteria

After fixes, debug log should show:
```
=== PP MAMS: MOD LOADING START ===
PP MAMS: Mod loaded and initialized successfully!
PP MAMS: Init cue executed - version 1.0
=== PP MAMS: MOD LOADING COMPLETE ===
```

Plus in-game notification: "PP MAMS Loaded - PP MAMS mod is now active!"

## Why Lua Was Originally Planned

Lua was intended for complex operations:
- Comparing pilot skills across entire fleet
- Finding best pilot candidates
- Moving crew between ships dynamically

But for initial loading test, pure MD script is sufficient and eliminates potential Lua loading issues.

## Next Steps After Loading Works

1. Confirm mod loads with minimal version
2. Add back core functionality using MD script only
3. Consider Lua only if MD script limitations require it
4. Focus on `event_object_built` ship purchase detection first

---

**Bottom Line**: Remove all Lua references, test minimal MD-only version, then build up functionality incrementally.
