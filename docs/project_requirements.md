I want to make an x4 mod.

Here's the template: https://github.com/temetvince/template-x4-mod
I've already included development research in `research_ideations.md`.

What I want: a mod called "Pilot Personnel Merit Assignment Management System" or PP MAMS (in militarese). (Fyi: (captain == pilot) in this game).

The mod action: when a new ship is purchased, the pilot will be replaced with one from the personnel pool, depending on certain conditions. If any other ship suddenly needs a pilot, the management system follows these rules:

1. If the new ship is for battle, grab the highest rated available pilot (scalping from a non-combat ship is ok) if possible.
2. If a non combat ship requires a captain, grab the highest ranking available (not critically assigned) crew member and reassign them to the non-combat ship in the captain's role.

Settings/Extensions/Mod options:
1. Notification on assignment (checkbox button)
2. Assignment in Logbook (checkbox button)
