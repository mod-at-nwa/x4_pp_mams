# Pilot Personnel Merit Assignment Management System (PP MAMS)

An X4: Foundations mod that automatically assigns optimal pilots to newly purchased ships based on merit and specific conditions.

## Features

- **Merit-Based Assignment**: Assigns pilots based on actual piloting skill ratings
- **Battle Ship Priority**: Combat vessels get the highest skilled pilots available
- **Smart Scalping**: Battle ships can recruit pilots from non-combat vessels when needed
- **Non-Combat Optimization**: Trade/mining ships get the best available crew from PHQ pool
- **Configurable Notifications**: Enable/disable in-game notifications and logbook entries
- **Save Game Safe**: Event-driven architecture that doesn't break existing saves

## How It Works

### Ship Classification
- **Battle Ships** (`purpose == 'fight'`): Fighters, destroyers, carriers
  - Get highest skilled pilots available
  - Can recruit from non-combat ships if needed
- **Non-Combat Ships**: Traders, miners, builders, etc.
  - Get best available crew from PHQ service pool
  - Protected from pilot recruitment by battle ships

### Assignment Logic
1. **New Ship Purchase**: When you buy a ship, PP MAMS:
   - Identifies if it's a battle or non-combat vessel
   - Searches for better pilots in your fleet/PHQ
   - Assigns the best available pilot based on piloting skill
   - Moves the original pilot to PHQ service crew

2. **Pilot Loss Events**: When a ship loses its pilot:
   - Automatically triggers the same assignment logic
   - Ensures your ships always have optimal crew

## Installation

### From Release
1. Download the latest release from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Extract the `pp_mams` folder
3. Copy to your X4 extensions directory:
   - **Steam**: `Documents\Egosoft\X4\<YourPlayerID>\extensions\`
   - **GOG/Epic**: Similar path in Documents folder
4. Launch X4 and enable "Pilot Personnel Merit Assignment Management System" in Settings > Extensions
5. Load your save or start a new game

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/meldrey/PRJ-369-017-x4_pp_mams.git
cp -r PRJ-369-017-x4_pp_mams/pp_mams ~/Documents/Egosoft/X4/<YourPlayerID>/extensions/
```

## Configuration

Edit parameters in `pp_mams/md/pp_mams.xml`:
- `notify` (default: true) - Show notifications when pilots are assigned
- `logbook` (default: true) - Write assignment events to logbook

## Requirements

- X4: Foundations (version 7.00+)
- Player Headquarters (PHQ) recommended for optimal functionality
- No other mod dependencies

## Testing

- **Restart X4** → Load v2.01 (clears cached XML errors)
- **Manual Commands** → Rename ship to `MAMS:FIRE` to fire pilot immediately
- **Automatic Detection** → Within 10 seconds, PP MAMS will detect and reassign automatically
- **Buy a new ship** → Periodic checks will optimize pilots within 10 seconds
- **Check debug log** → Should show "version 2.01" with detailed pilot scanning information
- **Monitor notifications** → Assignment confirmations appear when pilots are reassigned
- **Enhanced Debugging** → Debug log now shows pilot names, skills, and verification results

## Troubleshooting

- **XML errors in log**: Restart X4 to clear cached files from older versions
- **No assignments happening**: Ensure you have a PHQ built with service crew
- **Periodic checks not running**: Check debug log for "Starting periodic ship monitoring system"
- **Version mismatch**: Look for "version 1.15" in debug log to confirm latest version loaded
- **Scripts not running**: Enable debug mode: `-debug scripts -logfile debuglog.txt`
- **Assignment failures**: Check that you have available crew in PHQ

## Technical Details

- **Mission Director (MD)**: Pure XML-based event handling with periodic monitoring
- **Automatic Detection**: 10-second interval scanning for suboptimal pilots (skill < 3)
- **Skill Evaluation**: Piloting skill comparison determines optimal candidates
- **Event Architecture**: Uses `event_cue_signalled` with `delay` for proper timing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive safeguards prevent save corruption

## Critical Discovery: The Event-Driven Solution

After extensive research and extraction of X4's game files, we discovered the **md.Conversations.LogFired** cue in X4's conversation system - the holy grail of pilot detection!

### The Journey
- **v1.0 - v3.08**: Tried everything from periodic scanning (30s, then 10s intervals) to attempting impossible event hooks like `event_object_signalled`
- **Day 3 Breakthrough**: Extracted X4's CAT/DAT archives using [Xtract](https://github.com/RPINerd/Xtract) tool
- **Discovery**: Found `md.Conversations.LogFired` cue in `/md/conversations.xml` that fires when ANY crew member is dismissed
- **Solution**: `<event_cue_signalled cue="md.Conversations.LogFired" />` provides instant, event-driven pilot firing detection

### Key Learnings
1. **No Direct Pilot Events**: X4's MD system has NO `event_pilot_fired` or `event_crew_changed` events
2. **Complete MD Event List** (from `/libraries/md.xsd`):
   - `event_briefing_*` (briefing interactions)
   - `event_cue_*` (cue lifecycle)
   - `event_npc_created`, `event_platform_actor_created` (character spawning)
   - **NO personnel/pilot/crew events exist**
3. **The Workaround**: Hook into conversation system's `LogFired` cue instead
4. **The Bug**: Egosoft's `md.Conversations.LogFired` cue exists but is NEVER signalled by the game!
   - `g_pilotleave` and `g_fire` call `signal_objects` for AI scripts only
   - No `signal_cue` or `signal_cue_instantly` call exists in vanilla game
   - LogFired literally cannot fire without modding
5. **Our Fix**: Diff patch system to inject the missing signals
6. **Bonus Discovery**: `md.Conversations.LogHired` exists for hiring events (future enhancement)

### Technical Implementation

**Step 1: Patch the Game (conversations.xml diff)**
```xml
<diff xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="../libraries/diff.xsd">
  <!-- Add missing signal to g_pilotleave -->
  <add sel="//do_elseif[@value=&quot;event.param == 'g_pilotleave'&quot;]/do_if/signal_objects[@param=&quot;'npc__control_dismissed'&quot;]" pos="after">
    <signal_cue_instantly cue="md.Conversations.LogFired" param="event.object"/>
  </add>

  <!-- Add missing signal to g_fire -->
  <add sel="//do_elseif[@value=&quot;event.param == 'g_fire'&quot;]/do_else/signal_objects[@param=&quot;'npc__control_dismissed'&quot;]" pos="after">
    <signal_cue_instantly cue="md.Conversations.LogFired" param="event.object"/>
  </add>
</diff>
```

**Step 2: Listen for the Now-Working Event (pp_mams.xml)**
```xml
<cue name="PilotFiredListener" instantiate="true">
  <conditions>
    <event_cue_signalled cue="md.Conversations.LogFired" />
  </conditions>
  <actions>
    <!-- event.param contains the fired actor -->
    <set_value name="$fired_actor" exact="event.param" />
    <!-- Check if typename == 'pilot' and handle accordingly -->
  </actions>
</cue>
```

### Tools Used
- **Xtract**: Python-based CAT/DAT extractor for X4 game files
- **Command**: `python xtract.py "/path/to/X4" /output -t xml,xsd,html`
- **Files Extracted**:
  - `/libraries/md.xsd` - Complete MD schema with all events
  - `/md/conversations.xml` - Contains LogFired/LogHired cues
  - `scriptproperties.html` - Script property documentation

## Current Development Status (v3.13)

**IN PROGRESS - Debugging diff patch XPath selectors**

We've discovered Egosoft's oversight: `md.Conversations.LogFired` exists but is never signalled. We're patching the game to fix it.

**Current Issues:**
- Diff patch is being **processed** by X4 (major progress!) but XPath can't find target nodes
- XPath attempts:
  - v1-v2: Used `&quot;` - failed (not processed)
  - v3: Comment-based selectors - failed (not processed)
  - v4: Descendant search `//` - failed (not processed)
  - v5: Absolute paths `/mdscript/...` with `&quot;` - **PROCESSED but no match**
  - v6: Absolute paths with `&apos;` - **PROCESSED but no match**
  - Testing: Simplified XPath to find just `DefaultComm` cue
- Studied kuertee_attack_ai_tweaks working diff patches for reference

**What Works:**
- ✅ Event listener for `md.Conversations.LogFired` ready
- ✅ Event monitor for `event_platform_actor_created` (debug only)
- ✅ Mod loads correctly with version constants
- ✅ Diff patch file is recognized and processed by X4
- ✅ EventMonitor_NPCCreated disabled (too spammy)

**What's Broken:**
- ❌ XPath expressions can't locate target nodes in conversations.xml
- ❌ LogFired never fires because game doesn't signal it
- ❌ No real-time pilot firing detection until patch works

**Next Steps:**
- Test if basic cue selector works: `/mdscript/cues/cue[@name="DefaultComm"]`
- If basic path fails, investigate namespace or parsing issues
- Consider alternative approaches if XPath fundamentally blocked
